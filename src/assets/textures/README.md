# Game Textures

This directory is for storing game textures and visual assets.

Currently, the game uses basic Three.js geometries and materials, but this directory can be used to add:
- Fish textures
- Water effects
- Environment textures
- UI elements

To add custom textures, place image files in this directory and load them in the game code.
